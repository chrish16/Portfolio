						<p class="home-skills-text content-text">Your website is your most important piece of internet real estate- it is the first thing people will judge, so it is critical that it is well designed. Iâ€™m a huge fan of minimalism and flat design, and always start a project by creating the logo, the color scheme, and finally the wireframe or visual prototype.</p>

						<p class="home-skills-text content-text">After your website has been designed, it needs to be converted to code so that it can be viewed in a browser. I utilize modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery to create the static portion of websites while following the best practices for SEO and cross-browser compatibility.</p>

						<p class="home-skills-text content-text">Web applications are the future. In addition to presenting your information, why not use your website to collect data or manage customers? How about editing your content and updating your website on your own? I utilize PHP and MySQL to program dynamic, database-driven websites.</p>

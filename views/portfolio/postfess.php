					<h1 class="portfolio-heading">Postfess</h2>
					<p class="portfolio-text">Inspired by Candy Chang's community art project, &quot;<a href="http://candychang.com/confessions/" rel="nofollow">Confessions</a>,&quot; in January 2013 I began creating Postfess- an experimental social network where anonymous users post and share confessions and secrets.</p>
					<p class="portfolio-text">Unfortunately, due to work commitments, a lack of time, and the rise of &quot;<a href="https://www.secret.ly/" rel="nofollow">Secret</a>&quot; (which is a similar project) I see no point in continuing development of Postfess.</p>
					<p class="portfolio-text">The website was created with PHP.</p>

				<h3 class="portfolio-img-title">Confessions</h3>
				<p class="portfolio-img-caption">Postfess allows users to submit a confession from anywhere they are on the site. They simply click on &quot;Write a Confession&quot; in the header and the submission form slides down. They are limited to 150 characters per submission and may place their submission into a category and associate it with a color. Seen here, the homepage displays a grid of submitted confessions, filterable by category.</p>
